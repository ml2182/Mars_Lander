## Summer Coursework
I learnt how to simulate the mechanics of a system using Newton's laws and various numerical integrators. In addition, I successfully developed my own autopilot system, using basic control theory. The constraints were that the descent rate and the ground speed could not exceed 1m/s, along with limited fuel.

## Project Files

- [main.cpp](main.cpp): Implements the autopilot system using control theory.
- [graph.py](graph.py): Analyses descent data and produces graphs.
