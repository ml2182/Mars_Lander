## Summer Coursework
I learnt how to simulate the mechanics of a system using Newton's laws and various numerical integrators. In addition, I successfully developed my own autopilot system, using basic control theory, in main.cpp. The constraints were neither the the descent rate nor the ground speed could exceed 1m/s and the lander had limited fuel. I analysed the descent data using graph.py .
